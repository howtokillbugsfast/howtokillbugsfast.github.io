        <h4>Your Source IP Address/Location Information</h4>
        <p>As noted above, we may collect and store your device’s source IP address. This may disclose the location of your device at the time you access the Site. In addition, we may provide features on the Site that can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature. If you enable that feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device and will be used to serve you certain content tied to your location. If you elect to have your location-based searches saved to your history, we will store such information on our servers.</p>
        <h4>Use of Cookies and Web Beacons</h4>
        <p>Like many websites, our Site may use “cookies”, which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages and that record your preferences and actions. We use cookies to track use of our Site and online services. We may also use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Site and make it easier and/or relevant for your use.</p>
        <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline cookies, some features of the Site may not work or may not work as designed. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
        <p>We may also use web beacons. A web beacon (also known as an “action tag”, “tracer tag” or “single-pixel gif”) is an invisible graphic on a web page that is programmed to collect information about your use of a given website and deliver cookies.</p>
        <p>We may work with third-party advertising companies who may utilize web beacons to better provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. These companies do not have access to your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other Personal Information from us. They may, however, anonymously track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond the Site. To learn more about the use of this information or to choose not to have this information used by our third-party advertising partners by opting out please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org.</a></p>

        <h3><strong>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong></h3>
        <p>We will only disclose your Personal Information collected via the Site to other companies as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>We may disclose Personal Information and other information collected from you to our parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates.</p>
        <p>We may provide Personal Information and other information collected from you to companies that provide support services to us or perform functions on our behalf, such as marketing, analytics, processing credit card or payment transactions and providing customer service.. These companies may need Personal Information in order to perform their functions.</p>
        <p>We may disclose Personal Information and other information collected from you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend the our rights or property, the Site or our users, and (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of any of our employees, agents or contractors, or those of any of our parent companies, affiliates or subsidiaries, any users of the Site or the public.</p>
        <p>We may disclose Personal Information in connection with a sale of the Site or some or all of our business, assets or equity, a merger or other disposition of our company or a corporate reorganization. Please see the section below entitled “Assignment; Change of Ownership” for further information.</p>
        <p>We may disclose or share Non-Personal Information in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary. Among other things, we may disclose Non-Personal Information to third parties to help us determine how people use parts of the Site so we can improve our Site and customize new product offerings. We may provide Non-Personal Information about how our users collectively use the Site in aggregated form to our business partners and other third parties.</p>
        <h3><strong>INFORMATION YOU MAKE PUBLIC</strong></h3>
        <p>Please remember that any information you share in public areas, such as comment sections or forums, or that you otherwise post, display or disseminate in an area that is viewable by other users of the Site, becomes public. Please be careful about what you disclose and do not disclose any Personal Information that you expect to keep private.</p>
        <h3><strong>INFORMATION SECURITY</strong></h3>
        <p>We use reasonable efforts to safeguard Personal Information. For example, when we ask customers to provide credit card information, that information is protected using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. However, no data storage system or transmission method can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the security of any information (including Personal Information) that we obtain. We will not be liable for disclosure of any information due to errors in transmission or the any act or omission of any third party.</p>
        <h3><strong>GOVERNING LAW; NOTICE TO NON-U.S. USERS</strong></h3>
        <p>The Site is provided in the United States of America and our policies are directed at compliance with the laws of the United States of America and its constituent jurisdictions. If you are uncertain whether this Privacy Policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are located, you should not submit Personal Information to us.</p>
        <p>If you are located outside the United States of America, you should be aware that Personal Information about you will be transferred to the United States of America, the laws of which may be deemed by the your country to have inadequate data protection. If you are located in a country outside the United States of America and voluntarily submit personal information to us, you thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this privacy policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or storage of that information in, the United States of America.</p>
        <p>___</p>
        <h3><strong>ASSIGNMENT; CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP</strong></h3>
        <p>We may change our ownership or corporate organization, be sold or merge with another company. We may also sell assets associated with the Site. We will have the right to transfer some or all of the information in our possession, including Personal Information concerning users, in connection with a change of ownership, change of corporate organization, merger or sale of assets or equity.
